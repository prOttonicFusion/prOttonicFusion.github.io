description: A few words about my skills & career
---

My background in computational physics has provided me with a fairly solid set of skills, extending from scripting languages and the usage of the GNU/Linux environment, all the way to high-performance parallel programming and large-scale data analytics.

I'm also self-taught in various full stack web and app development tools, skills which I'm now taking further working as a part-time software developer and taking on odd WebDev assignments.
